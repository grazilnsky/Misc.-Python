<h1>Audiogram Help</h1>

<p></p>
<h2>What?</h2>

<p>The Audiogram is an application which allows the user to measure their hearing range. This application plots a graph
which indicates that range as well as the minimum volume for hearing each frequency.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Set the frequency to any value, and the volume as low as needed. Once you hear the sound, press the "Record" button. Afterward change the frequency and repeat. When you are done, you can press
the "Plot" button in order to see the graph. </p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>The maximum hearing range for a human is between 20Hz and 20kHz. The higher frequencies usually become more difficult to hear with age.</p>
