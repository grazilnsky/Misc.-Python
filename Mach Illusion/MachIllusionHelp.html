<h1>Mach Illusion Help</h1>

<p></p>
<h2>What?</h2>

<p>This application facilitates observing the effect of Mach’s illusion. Mach’s illusion
works by exaggerating the contrast between edges of the slightly differing
shades of gray, as soon as they contact one another, by triggering
edge-detection in the human visual system.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Use the sliders to change the shade of each block. The illusion consists in seeing a flash at the border between two blocks of gray.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Visual illusions like Mach's Illusion can sometimes be impossible to not be seen. This is because the brain adjusts the difference of color between two objects such that the color change appears gradual, rather than steep.</p>
