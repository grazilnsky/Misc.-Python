<h1>Angular Resolution Help</h1>

<p></p>
<h2>What?</h2>

<p>Angular Resolution is an application which displays 2 parallel lines and with the help of 2 sliders. These sliders allow you to change the
distance between the lines, or the thickness of the lines. The angular view from your perspective can be computed by pressing the compute button.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Use sliders(fig.1, fig.2) to change the distance between lines(fig.1)
and the thickness(fig.2) of the
lines. When you will see 1 line, the box(fig.3)
write the distance(in centimeters) from the eye to the screen and press
“Calculate” button(fig.4) in order to
compute your angular view.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>It’s important to have knowledge about the human body, specifically about properties of the eye, such as visual angle. This is what the application is useful for</p>
